US STEM Foundation President Doug Donegan Discusses Local Science,
Technology, Engineering and Math Initiatives

WashingtonExec interviewed US STEM Foundation President, Doug Donegan,
about the organization’s mission and how companies and employees alike
can support Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)
initiatives.  Doug talks about the importance of creating opportunities
for students to participate in hands-on experiential learning activities
that challenge their intellect and enhance their ability to creatively
collaborate.


WashintonExec: What motivated the creation of the US STEM Foundation?

Doug Donegan: Four years ago a group of parents, teachers and business
leaders who sought to give students more opportunities to participate in
hands-on technology-based activities formed the US STEM Foundation in
Haymarket, Virginia.  Battlefield High School had a growing robotics
program there that was drawing students to STEM activities at an
impressive rate.  Not only did the students respond well to the robotics
activities and the inherent technical lessons, they were learning some
significant life lessons about collaboration and responsibility.  What
started as a club became and team and evolved into a culture of
excellence fueled by the students’ enthusiasm for the activities and
challenges.  At the time I was a corporate sponsor and from the
sidelines found the whole experience to be motivating and inspiring. 
Personally, I was jealous of the opportunities that these students had,
but at the same time I was thrilled by their level of engagement and the
way the students grew personally and academically.

It was clear that these robotics activities were changing the trajectory
of the students.  However, we could also see that the enthusiasm and
attraction was going to quickly outpace the resources.  We also
recognized that this was not a unique experience, other communities were
going to be experiencing the same predicament and were going to need
help.  Extracurricular STEM programs are resource intensive.  They
require investment in special material sets, tools and infrastructure. 
Just as important are the personal investments needed; these programs
require mentors and advisors to assist the students and foster their
development.  When it comes to larger group activities, volunteers are
needed to coordinate events and make sure they run smoothly and safely. 
None of these activities or events could happen without donors whose
generosity helps subsidize the costs of facilities, infrastructure and
materials.

The US STEM Foundation was formed to address these needs. Fundamentally,
we understood that STEM activities needed a hybrid support structure
that combines the best elements of the sports league and band booster
models.  Much like a football or soccer team, extracurricular STEM
activities requires coaches with knowledge of the activity, special
equipment, and space to practice and play games.  And like a band
booster club, STEM activities need to come together to raise money for
instruments, practice sessions and travel.  Bringing together these
models, the US STEM Foundation has defined its mission to coordinate and
subsidize activities that inspire the next generation of STEM
professionals leveraging programs hands-on activities, services and
strategies that will engage, educate, develop and create responsible
citizens.


WashingtonExec: STEM topics in general are getting significant attention
in education and business.  What is driving the focus being placed upon
STEM education? 

Doug Donegan:  The focus on STEM is both economic and
strategic.  Several studies and articles have been published about the
upcoming deficit of STEM professionals in the workforce.  The work that
brought STEM to the forefront is a report entitled Rising Above the
Gathering Storm, which was authored in 2007 by a joint committee from
the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering
and the Institute of Medicine.   The joint committee was convened to
discuss how America could continue to prosper in the global economy of
the 21st century.  The report the committee produced became an agenda
for the American Science and Technology Committee on Engineering and
Public Policy.  The authors of the report penned detailed responses to
several questions related to the state of science and technology
education and detailed the steps necessary for “Energizing and Employing
America for a Brighter Economic Future.”  It makes several
recommendations on the actions America should take to remain prosperous
in the 21st century in terms of K-12 education, science and engineering
research, higher education and economic policy.   The study concludes
with a call to action by theorizing about “what life might be like, if
America became noncompetitive in Science and Technology”.  Alternatively, one of my favorite books on this subject is The U.S.
Technology Skills Gap – What Every Technology Executive Must Know to
Save America’s Future by Gary J. Beach.  Beach goes beyond defining the
issue and outlining the challenges that need to be overcome, he devotes
a significant portion of his book to the work that companies and other
organizations are doing to address the “skills gap”, which is both
insightful and inspiring. 

Fundamentally, there are several drivers to
this issue, but I want to specifically dismiss the notion that as a
nation our young people lack interest or potential to succeed in STEM
professions.  Our students are demonstrating interest in STEM curriculum
and our universities are not lacking for students pursuing technical
degrees.  However, that is not to say that the supply is keeping up with
the demand.  The two largest factors in this demand are the retirement
of baby boomer engineers and the increasing technical requirements of
newly created jobs.  The baby boomers are exiting the workforce at a
rate higher than we can backfill the technical ranks.  This has
significant impact as the more senior engineers retire there will be
less technical leaders to train the new generation.  At the other end of
the spectrum, the number of careers that demand technical proficiency is
significantly increasing as technology evolves and consumers demand more
from products and services.  The United States won’t address this
deficiency with quantity, but with dedicated focus from education
professionals and strategic investment from industry we will make best
attempts to address it with quality.  The more we can develop our future
STEM workforce, the better our chances are at retaining our relevancy as
world leaders in technology and innovation. 

The good news is that
forward-looking corporations understand this need and are making
strategic investments to subsidize the development of their future
workforce.  They recognize that an investment today will yield
tremendous benefit when their future work force arrives with more
capability.  Smart companies know you just can’t flip a switch and ask a
group of young people to collaborate and be innovative; in addition to
being introduced to technical concepts there are several personal skills
that need to be developed through experience.  So much emphasis in our
culture is put upon individual performance and competitive performance. 
As professionals we value strong performers, but we place even more
value on contributors who deliver and collaborate to make the team
stronger and more productive.  The activities the US STEM Foundation
supports are very similar to projects we take on as professionals, they
are sufficiently broad and complex such that one strong contributor
can’t make the difference.  The challenges must be tackled as a team and
draw upon the strengths and inputs from several students with a diverse
skill set.  The US STEM Foundation likes to advertise that we are
helping train your corporation’s future talent pool; improving their
technical acumen and enhancing their ability to creatively collaborate
and innovate.  


WashintonExec: Is this an educational concept here to stay or will it be
overtaken when a new theory is introduced? 

Doug Donegan: I’m not an education professional, so I can’t speak to 
what models are being developed by academics that study and develop these models.  
However, as an engineer I assert that STEM is an excellent way to address the
educational needs of this generation.  I opine that the focus on STEM is
appropriate and based on sound education theory.  Given the need to
deliver a quality STEM workforce to the market, I don’t think we can
afford to divert our focus on STEM, but we should always try to improve
upon it and extend it. 

In the 1990s the National Science Foundation married Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Math with the acronym STEM.  Judith A. Ramaley, the former 
director of the National Science Foundation’s Education and Human Resources 
division, is credited with coining the term.  The traditional Science and 
Mathematics subjects that we grow up with are recognized as the bookends 
and enablers for the applied subjects of Technology and Engineering.  After 
years of research educators understand that these subjects cannot and 
should not be taught in isolation.  Curriculum is being adjusted in 
attempts to integrate the subjects and implement this approach.  As 
professionals we know that they do not exist in isolation in the workforce.

The US STEM Foundation recognizes that many STEM activities don’t always fit 
well into the confines of classroom time.  We seek to assist in implementing
this concept by supporting extracurricular hands-on activities that
allow students to explore and apply these subjects.
